# career-ops -- Router

## Mode Routing

Determine the mode from `{{mode}}`:

| Input | Mode |
|-------|------|
| (empty / no args) | `discovery` -- Show command menu |
| JD text or URL (no sub-command) | **`auto-pipeline`** |
| `full` | `full` |
| `outreach` | `outreach` |
| `deep` | `deep` |
| `pdf` | `pdf` |
| `training` | `training` |
| `project` | `project` |
| `tracker` | `tracker` |
| `apply` | `apply` |
| `scan` | `scan` |
| `eval` | `eval` |
| `batch` | `batch` |

**Auto-pipeline detection:** If `{{mode}}` is not a known sub-command AND contains JD text (keywords: "responsibilities", "requirements", "qualifications", "about the role", "we're looking for", company name + role) or a URL to a JD, execute `auto-pipeline`.

If `{{mode}}` is not a sub-command AND doesn't look like a JD, show discovery.

## Discovery Mode (no arguments)

Show this menu:

```
career-ops -- Command Center

Available commands:
  /career-ops {JD}      → AUTO-PIPELINE: evaluate + report + PDF + tracker (paste text or URL)
  /career-ops full    → Evaluation only A-F (no auto PDF)
  /career-ops outreach  → LinkedIn power move: find contacts + draft message
  /career-ops deep      → Deep research prompt about company
  /career-ops pdf       → PDF only, ATS-optimized CV
  /career-ops training  → Evaluate course/cert against North Star
  /career-ops project   → Evaluate portfolio project idea
  /career-ops tracker   → Application status overview
  /career-ops apply     → Live application assistant (reads form + generates answers)
  /career-ops scan      → Scan portals, discover new postings, write to DB
  /career-ops eval {ids} → Light evaluate selected postings
  /career-ops batch     → Batch processing with parallel workers

Or paste a JD directly to evaluate it.
```

## Context Loading by Mode

After determining the mode, load the necessary files before executing:

### Modes that require `_shared.md` + their mode file:
Read `modes/_shared.md` + `modes/{mode}.md`

Applies to: `auto-pipeline`, `full`, `pdf`, `outreach`, `apply`, `scan`, `eval`, `batch`

### Standalone modes (only their mode file):
Read `modes/{mode}.md`

Applies to: `tracker`, `deep`, `training`, `project`

### Modes delegated to subagent:
For `scan`, `eval`, and `apply` (with Playwright): launch as Agent with the content of `_shared.md` + `modes/{mode}.md` injected into the subagent prompt.

```
Agent(
  subagent_type="general-purpose",
  prompt="[content of modes/_shared.md]\n\n[content of modes/{mode}.md]\n\n[invocation-specific data]",
  description="career-ops {mode}"
)
```

Execute the instructions from the loaded mode file.
